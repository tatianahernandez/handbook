# Team Resume Instructions

We sometimes get requests for team resumes. We use a template for formatting team resumes so they are consistent.

## Process

1. The CivicActions resume template will be provided to you during your onboarding sessions.
2. You will make a copy of the resume template and PeopleOps will help you complete the resume as needed.
3. PeopleOps will also request copies of your degrees and certificates to keep on file.
5. When you complete your resume, email PeopleOps a link back to the same resume draft first provided and also include the certs and degrees as noted above.
6. PeopleOps will do final review and save your resume in the team resumes folder.
